# Contributing to TrackMyFinances

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **TrackMyFinances**! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the project, the review process, and our contribution standards.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Before you start working on any changes, make sure to fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
   
2. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`.

3. **Write Clean, Well-Documented Code**: Ensure that your code follows standard best practices. Include comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: When you're ready to submit your changes:
   - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch by merging or rebasing.
   - Submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
   - Provide a detailed description of the changes, the issue it solves (if applicable), and any steps required to test the changes.
   
5. **Code Review Process**: 
   - All pull requests require approval from the repository code owner (@jmxenhancer) before they can be merged.
   - **Require Conversation Resolution**: All conversations on the pull request must be resolved before merging.
   - PRs may require feedback or revisions, so make sure to address comments and push updates to the same branch.

6. **Branch Protection Rules**:
   - **Pull Requests Required**: Direct commits to the `main` branch are not allowed. All changes must be made through pull requests.
   - **Code Owner Approval**: Since @jmxenhancer is the code owner, all pull requests must be reviewed and approved by @jmxenhancer.
   - **Require Conversation Resolution**: All conversations on a PR must be resolved before it is allowed to merge.
   - **Up-to-Date Branch**: The branch must be up-to-date with the latest changes from `main` to avoid conflicts before merging.

## Commit Messages

Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Keep the commit message concise but descriptive (e.g., "Fix bug in payment calculation").
- For major changes, explain why the change was made.
